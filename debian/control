Description: Library for collision detection between convex shapes - shared library
 libccd implements variation on Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm + Expand
 Polytope Algorithm (EPA). It also implements Minkowski Portal Refinement (MPR,
 a.k.a. XenoCollide) algorithm as published in Game Programming Gems 7. libccd
 is one of the very few open source libraries that include MPR algorithm working
 in 3-D space.  However, there is a library called mpr2d, implemented in D
 programming language, that works in 2-D space.
 .
 This package gathers the shared library
